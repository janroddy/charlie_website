***PHP Part II:
Expand on your Form Validation project. After validation, your form data should be directed to a PHP
page that will grab the data and return a nicely formatted document to the browser.
Hard requirement: Use PHP decisions (If, Switch) combined with CSS in your formatting. A common
choice for this is to create a table of data where the rows are alternating colors. This is welldocumented (research, but do not plagiarize) and a very common thing to do. You can use some other
scheme of formatting that uses PHP decision and CSS. Whatever you decide, include a link at the
bottom of the form that describes what you did along with important code snippets.
