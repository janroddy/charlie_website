				<p id="about_text" class="center">Charles Wallace Roddy-Foster was born in Absarokee, MT on July 19th. He lives with his parents in Missoula, MT and spends a lot of time with his extended family.  He responds to many names including but not limited to "Char Char," "Charlie-Pie," and "Sweet Boy."  He gives excellent cuddles and enjoys long walks on the beach. With a taste for the finer things, he is a bit of a picky eater but loves carrots and ice cream.</p>
